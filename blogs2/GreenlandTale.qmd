10th July 2023

Today marks the first day of what I expect will be a spectacular trip. My friend Simon dropped me at the airport with good time. Yet, all the normal anxieties and doubts of going through airport security gripped me, but as always there were no issues. We took off from Nantes in glorious sunshine with a gleam of perspiration coating my forehead. This being partly due to my anxiety at flying and partly due to dressing for the Copenhagen climes. It was an easy short flight with quite special views across the Wadden sea dotted with islets, banks and channels. The clear views and smooth flight quite rapidly turned into a juddering uneasy descent into the city. The approach into Copenhagen, similar to that of Dublin, Hong Kong or Vancouver, seems to be straight into the sea with the runway appearing at the very last second. Once through the airport at the other end the walk to the hotel, which I have been booked into, could not have been easier. Having freshened up and deposited my luggage I quickly turned around and was on the metro into town. I have little to no knowledge of the city but had been given one recommendation. Therefore, I headed straight for the “little mermaid” known locally as “Den Lille Havfrue”.

It is a bronze sculpture of a young lady sat in a side-saddle style on a rock on the coast. The ripples of the boats’ wakes brush her feet while the tourists pose, and the pigeons pray on the treats of the unsuspecting crowd. Being a working port, Copenhagen has the industrial concrete factories overlooking the water, while also containing a plethora of quaint small wood or red brick façade houses. This quick sojourn in the Danish capital was an added bonus. The real journey starts tomorrow. 

12th July 

The approach to Narsarsuaq was the most breathtaking view I have ever seen. Flying in we descended through the low clouds that stretched over the vast north of Greenland. As far as the eye could see was pure white glaciers that gave sharp contrast to the dark crags of rock, towering above even us on our descent. The landing approach brought us gliding in over the fjord where my new home, Tarajoq, sat waiting.

I had never seen glaciers or icebergs up close before but already within less than 24 hours I had become desensitised. Being formed by glacial movement, I see strong similarities between the Greenland landscape and the glens of the Scottish Highlands. We are alongside (in the harbour) at Narsaq waiting for the last members of the crew to join us. During this time I have the not-so-minor task of familiarising myself with Greenland Fauna.

16th July

Life on board Tarajoq is starting to fall into a routine now, the most breath-taking, stunning and surreal routine but not without numbing fatigue at the end of each shift. The cruise personnel are split into cooks (most important), ‘fish people’ (fisheries scientists), benthos people (us), deck crew, mechanics, helmsmen, skipper and cruise leader. We sail up the east coast of Greenland, going from predetermined station to predetermined station. At each, we carry out a fishery trawl. All personnel are split onto shifts, so, as a whole, we fish 24 hours a day. My shift is midday to midnight and alongside the fish people we sort through each catch. The fish people take the fish and we take everything else. After a few days the wee beasties we catch are mostly becoming known to me, meaning our job of sorting, identifying and counting is becoming easier. While a lot of what we catch is similar between trawls we are starting to get mind-blowingly cool species and specimens too. So far, we have caught and released with a tag, 3 Greenland sharks. At over 4 metres long they will all be very old. When I say old, I cannot be sure, no one is, but it is likely they are older than the USA, maybe even alive during the Tudor times in the UK. Other amazing specimens of fish have also turned up, including multiple 30 + kg Cod, Halibut and Rays. Once my shift is done, especially after processing 700kg of sponge by hand, I have been in need of a cold dip. While swimming in the sea is out of the question, we do have a huge dunk tank and a tap that draws sea water at around 4oC from the water around us. This allows cold dips before turning in for the night. We are skirting around but also through vast ice flows that are both spectacular to see in the day and terrifying to hear in the night, as we smash our path through them.  

22nd July

The routine continues: wake up; take a multivitamin; grab a coffee and head to the bridge; admire either the beautiful vistas or rolling waves, whale blows, icebergs and Greenlandic mountains or feel the chill of fear looking out into impenetrable fog with icebergs looming out of the nothingness; the it is time to feed before descending to the factory to sort, identify and count all species we catch with the trawl. As we head north along the eastern shelf of Greenland we can feel the cold intensifying. This is most apparent during my evening “swims”. The “swimming pool” is a reconstituted fishing box, previously used to store fish on ice to keep fresh; now it is filled daily with sea water of around 1-6 oC and sat in by myself and others of the crew. While the shock to the system seems extreme, the serenity I feel being sat in near-freezing water after a 12 hour shift spent lifting and moving (often entirely by hand) up to 4,500 kg of sponge is so relaxing, revitalising and reinvigorating. This cold dip then helps, while Tarajoq rocks with the swell, to send me off to the most tranquil, unbroken sleep I have ever experienced. The trawls, apart from literal tonnes of sponges, have yielded an amazing range of species from ancient Greenland sharks, monster cod and halibut to intricate deep sea Paragorgia corals. So far, the highlights have been the cute and sassy bobtail squids (Rossia sp.), grumpy octopuses (Bathypolypus sp.) and a small star covered smoothhound (Squalus acanthius).  In between trawls we get up to an hour of break, if the previous trawl didn’t catch too much. In that time, I have taken to sitting on top of the spare trawl nets, which are stored on the upper decks, looking out to sea, just waiting for the blow of a whale or the passing flight of the many sea birds that share these fishing grounds. Currently, we are gliding across almost gloss smooth waters but this is just “the calm before the storm”. The cook tells me we are about to meet a summer storm. If this happens the skipper’s job will be to decide where to weather the storm. As we won’t be able to fish during the storm we will need to hide either inshore in one of the many fjords along Greenland’s east coast or head further offshore in deeper, calmer waters. Both scenarios have their advantages and disadvantages but only once the storm arrives will the decision be made. 

27th July

Thankfully the weather forecasts were correct, and a quick steam up north meant we skirted the storm, avoiding the worst of the weather. That being said, we still were exposed to the odd 5-10 metre wave with consistent 4 metre rolling swells for 3 days. The rocking motion made my sleep even better, although I know many who barely slept a wink. All crew and researchers got into the habit of continuously swaying, pre-emptively moving with the ocean rather than against it. As the storm abated and the weather cleared it allowed for one of the most vividly coloured sunsets I have ever seen. The whole world turned to sepia in the orange-red glow, giving the appearance of a dramatic fire raging just out of view. With it the sunset brought thin streaks of purple cloud, forming wisps of colour across the expanse of clear blue sky. After days that felt like weeks of close fog and clouds, the clear skies all the way to the horizon gave a feeling of relief. The sea was beginning to calm although it still held some of the energy of the storm. This calming gave way to the now regular spouts of air and water signifying the continual migration, movement and searching for food by the biggest animals to ever live. While a professional or even an avid amateur can tell the whale from the shape, size and frequency of its breaths, I cannot. The only species easy to identify, which whalers took great advantage of, is the sperm whale. The elongated head and offset nostril means a sperm whales spout shoots out at 45 degrees forward and off to one side. I have now seen many spouts of air, many off to one side, yet apart from the momentary glimpse of a tail or back, I haven’t seen any of these whales up close. My day-to-day shift continues as before with the odd species alluding me, but most are becoming well known to me. Alongside our fishing trawls we are also deploying video camera sleds, which in the same way as the trawl, is dragged along the seabed and captures all in its path. However, it captures organisms in their natural habitat and more importantly captures them only on film. Comparing the video and trawl results side-by-side allows us to see both the differences and similarities between the methods. As we come to the end of the survey each trawl becomes more special as I savour each new identification. Once the survey is finished our next adventure will be the crossing to Iceland. The fine and clear forecast bodes well for an easy crossing and while I am keen to see Iceland it will mean an end to this trip, which I am far less keen on. 

29th July 

Today marks the day when all sampling sites have been sampled. As with most fieldwork this trip included a few days of contingency for bad weather or equipment failure. However, through luck, efficient planning and hard work we have finished early. We still have other duties such as cleaning, equipment maintenance, as well as trying to tag as many Cod (Gadus morhua) as possible. During this increased downtime we are sailing along the Greenlandic coast, over calm seas, under clear skies and alongside a vast array of glacial mountainsides. This route brings us closer to more icebergs, which drift along beside us, often following our wake, driven by the currents on the surface and other times moving at odds to local wind, waves and currents. Being closer in to the shore brings us nearer to the playgrounds of a range of species. Unlike when we were offshore, surrounded by Fullmars and the occasional spout of migrating whales, inshore we see a variety of seabirds and larger pods of whales. Gannets, which I have not spotted so far, now circle us, occasionally pausing and the plummeting into the cold waves, and Petrels flit mere centimetres above the lightly moving water, giving the illusion of dancing across the peaks and troughs of the barely shifting swell. With the days of contingency not wanting to be wasted, the ships primary goal currently is to find cod. Up until now we have been trawling specific stations to assess, in a standardised way, the distribution of this highly prized fish. Now we are on the hunt. If we can catch a large quantity we can insert tags into the fish that means when that individual is caught we can see where it ends up. Each tag is a small plastic streamer with a unique ID number. This means any fisher who catches a tagged fish can tell the Greenlandic fisheries institute where and when it was caught. These types of passive tracking can allow researchers to find out where fish go and when they go there, to better understand and therefore manage these fish. 

31st July

After two and a half days, still working on 12 hour shifts, we have managed to tag over 2,000 cod. The work is short and intense; when a trawl comes up, if it has cod we tag them. If no cod come up then the trawl is emptied, reset and redeployed. However, the last trawl for this trip has come up; the last cod tagged; the last organism identified. Sometime today we will set sail for Iceland, crossing the Denmark strait and bound for Reykjavik. The crossing will take around 24 hours and we will clean and tidy to keep busy. As the shift structure ends for all scientists, we will also be playing a game of who can stay up latest for the night shifters and who can wake up earliest for the day shifters. Over the last few days, we have slowly been transitioning to Icelandic time from Greenlandic time. With the last trawl came two huge and beautiful Greenland sharks. Over the last 21 days at sea we have caught 7 of these slow, hardy giants, yet, I am still in awe of them every time. Their size and age just make me wonder what has happened over their lifetimes: what ships have sailed above them? Unbeknownst to them did they cross the path of the Titanic or witness the U-boats of World War 2? With a potential age of more than 500 years, did they even see the Niña, Pinta and Santa Maria as they sailed to discover the people already living in North America? Very unlikely given the route Columbus took but the incredible age of these creatures and their relatively unknown behaviour highlights how little we still know about our oceans.

3rd August

It is my last night in the North. We landed in Iceland in Hafnarfjörður yesterday and, after being cleared by customs, were allowed to get our feet on dry land. After almost 3 weeks on board, being ashore was a big shock. It was interesting to realise how continuously noisy the boat was. The constant thrum of the engines, the crashing of waves, the booming sound of our hull hitting icebergs. All these noises just faded into the background. This made the still, calm, quiet of land feel almost eerie, perhaps too quiet! Hafnarfjörður is only 6 km south of Reykjavik, so we quickly made the short trip to the capital. After visiting the magnificent cathedral, which my sister tells me was informed by the ‘post-industrial rationalist movement in Holland and Southern Germany’, we decided to wander around Reykjavik but somehow got continually waylaid by liquid refreshment. The dry ship rules of the three weeks have produced a healthy thirst. From some extensive tasting I can conclude that the brewing culture in Reykjavik is amazing, the only drawback being the eye-watering price tag for a pint: £8-£10!! Tonight is my last night as a scientist on board the research vessel Tarajoq. My travel home will see me fly from Reykjavik to Paris then catch a train from Paris back home to Nantes. I would be lying if I said I wasn’t keen to be heading home but it would also be a huge lie to say I haven’t loved this trip. It has kept me on my toes with hundreds if not thousands of new experiences. I have been so active carrying baskets of sponges to identify; washing down the grab we used to sample mud from over five hundred metres depth; helping tag cod or counting and recording hundreds of jellyfish at a time. When not physically active the intellectual tasks have been just as rewarding, working out the taxonomic identities of different deep-sea spiders, squid, starfish or any number of other groups of species. The work itself has been extremely fun with brand new species almost every trawl. However, as fun and interesting as all these elements have been the overwhelming comfort I have felt at being on a boat, at sea, travelling across the great expanse of the ocean outstrips them all. It makes me realise that wherever I am, whatever I do, it must include being on, in or under the sea.
