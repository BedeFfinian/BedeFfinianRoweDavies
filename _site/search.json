    "section": "",
    "text": "Davies et al., 2023\n\nAbstract\nMonitoring biodiversity and how anthropogenic pressures impact this is critical, especially as anthropogenically driven climate change continues to affect all ecosystems. Intertidal areas are exposed to particularly high levels of pressures owing to increased population density in coastal areas. Traditional methods of monitoring intertidal areas do not provide datasets with full coverage in a cost-effective or timely manner, and so the use of remote sensing to monitor these areas is becoming more common. Monitoring of ecologically important monospecific habitats, such as seagrass beds, using remote sensing techniques is well documented. However, the ability for multispectral data to distinguish efficiently and accurately between classes of vegetation with similar pigment composition, such as seagrass and green algae, has proved difficult, often requiring hyperspectral data. A machine learning approach was used to differentiate between soft-bottom intertidal vegetation classes when exposed at low tide, comparing 6 different multi- and hyperspectral remote and in situ sensors. For the library of 366 spectra, collected across Northern Europe, high accuracy (&gt;80%) was found across all spectral resolutions. While a higher spectral resolution resulted in higher accuracy, there was no discernible increase in accuracy above 10 spectral bands (95%: Sentinel-2 MSI sensor with a spatial resolution of 20 m). This work highlights the ability of multispectral sensors to discriminate intertidal vegetation types, while also showing the most important wavelengths for this discrimination (∼530 and ∼ 730 nm), giving recommendations for spectral ranges of future satellite missions. The ability for multispectral sensors to aid in accurate and rapid intertidal vegetation classification at the taxonomic resolution of classes, could be a significant contribution for future sustainable and effective ecosystem management."

    "title": "A Decade Implementing Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries Management Improves Diversity of Taxa and Traits within a Marine Protected Area in the UK.",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Davies et al., 2022\nAim: Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries Management has highlighted the importance of studying ecosystem functions and services, and the biological traits that drive them. Yet, ecosystem services and the associated benefits that they provide are rarely the motive for creating marine protected area (MPA). Therefore, many MPA monitoring projects do not explicitly study these functions and services or the underlying biological traits linked to them. Location: Lyme Bay MPA, located in the SW of England, was established in 2008 to protect the reef biodiversity across a 206 km\\(^2\\) area, which includes rocky reef habitats, pebbly sand and soft muddy sediments. Mobile demersal fishing was excluded across the whole site to allow the recovery of the reef habitats. Methods: Using a combination of towed underwater video and Baited Remote Underwater Video Systems changes in diversity (taxonomic and trait), and traits affected by mobile demersal fishing were assessed in Lyme Bay MPA over 10 years. Results: There was a consistent increase in the number of taxa and the trait diversity they provide within the MPA as well as an increase in functional redundancy, which may increase community resilience to perturbations. Outside of the MPA there was an increase in the abundance of mobile species, while the MPA showed an increase in filter feeders. Main conclusions: The MPA showed a trend towards more diverse and potentially resilient rocky reef habitats. This study constitutes a novel MPA assessment using multiple sampling methods to encompass a wide range of taxa. It also reinforces the importance of effective MPA monitoring, which has demonstrated changes in trait diversity and trait composition driven by changes in taxonomic diversity."

However, due to increased tourism, waste is accumulating on the mountain, with a large proportion being made of plastic. This research aimed to identify and characterize microplastic (MP) pollution near the top of highest mountain on Earth and could illustrate the implications for the environment and the people living below. Stream water and snow were collected from multiple locations leading up to, and including, the Balcony (8,440 m.a.s.l). MPs were detected at an ~30 MP L\\(^−1\\) in snow and ~1 MP L\\(^−1\\) in stream water, and the majority were fibrous. Therefore, with increased tourism, deposition of MP near Mt. Everest is expected to rise. At a pivotal point in the exploration of remote areas, environmental stewardship should focus on technological and other advances toward minimizing sources of MP pollution."

    "text": "Napper et al., 2021\nMicroplastics (plastic &lt; 5 mm in size) are now known to contaminate riverine systems but understanding about how their concentrations vary spatially and temporally is limited. This information is critical to help identify key sources and pathways of microplastic and develop management interventions. This study provides the first investigation of microplastic abundance, characteristics and temporal variation along the Ganges river; one of the most important catchments of South Asia. From 10 sites along a 2575 km stretch of the river, 20 water samples (3600 L in total) were filtered (60 samples each from pre- and post-monsoon season). Overall, 140 microplastic particles were identified, with higher concentrations found in the pre-monsoon (71.6%) than in post-monsoon (61.6%) samples. The majority of microplastics were fibres (91%) and the remaining were fragments (9%). We estimate that the Ganges, with the combined flows of the Brahmaputra and Meghna rivers (GBM), could release up to 1–3 billion (10\\(^9\\)) microplastics into the Bay of Bengal (north-eastern portion of the Indian Ocean) every day. This research provides the first step in understanding microplastic contamination in the Ganges and its contribution to the oceanic microplastic load."

    "text": "Bridger et al., 2022\nThe United Kingdom’s first large-scale, offshore, long-line mussel farm deployed its first ropes in 2013 in Lyme Bay, southwest United Kingdom, located in an area of seabed that was heavily degraded due to historic bottom-towed fishing. It was hypothesised that due to the artificial structures that accumulate mussels and exclude destructive fishing practices, the seabed could be restored. To assess the restoration potential of the farm and its ecosystem interactions over time, a multi-method, annual monitoring approach was undertaken. Here, we tested the effects of the farm trial stations on the seabed habitat, epifauna and demersal species over 5 years. Responses of % mussel cover, sessile and sedentary, and mobile taxa were measured using three video methods. Within 2 years of infrastructure deployment, mussel clumps and shells were detected below the headlines, increasing the structural complexity of the seabed. After 4 years, there was a significantly greater abundance of mobile taxa compared to the Controls that remained open to trawling. Commercial European lobster and edible crab were almost exclusively recorded within the farm. We discuss whether these findings can be considered a restoration of the seabed and how these data can be used to inform the future management of offshore mariculture globally."

However, this type of interactionhas been rarely investigated over the long term and at the scale of the wholeseagrass habitat. In this work, reciprocal links between an intertidal seagrassspecies,Zostera noltei, and a herbivorous bird feeding on this seagrass species,the migratory gooseBranta bernicla bernicla, were investigated using an originalcombination of long-term Earth Observation (EO) and bird census data. Sea-grass Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs) such as seagrass abundance andphenology were measured from 1985 to 2020 using high-resolution satelliteremote sensing over Bourgneuf Bay (France), and cross-analysed within situmeasurements of bird population size during the goose wintering season. Ourresults showed a mutual relationship between seagrass and Brent geese over thefour last decades, suggesting that the relationship between the two speciesextends beyond a simple grass—herbivore consumptive effect. We provided evi-dence of two types of interactions: (i) a bottom-up control where the late-summer seagrass abundance drives the wintering population of herbivorousgeese and (ii) an indirect top-down effect of Brent goose on seagrass habitat,where seagrass development is positively influenced by the bird population dur-ing the previous wintering season. Such a mutualistic relationship has strongimplications for biodiversity conservation because protecting one species isbeneficial to the other one, as demonstrated here by the positive trajectoriesobserved from 1985 to 2020 in both seagrass and bird populations. Importantly,we also demonstrated here that exploring the synergy between EO andin situbird data can benefit seagrass ecology and ecosystem management."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Sheehan et al., 2021\nMarine protected areas (MPAs) are employed as tools to manage human impacts, especially fishing pressure. By excluding the most destructive activities MPAs can rewild degraded areas of seabed habitat. The potential for MPAs to increase ecosystem resilience from storms is, however, not understood, nor how such events impact seabed habitats. Extreme storm disturbance impact was studied in Lyme Bay MPA, Southwest United Kingdom, where the 2008 exclusion of bottom-towed fishing from the whole site allowed recovery of degraded temperate reef assemblages to a more complex community. Severe storm impacts in 2013–2014 resulted in major damage to the seabed so that assemblages in the MPA were more similar to sites where fishing continued than at any point since the designation of the MPA; the communities were not dominated by species resistant to physical disturbance. Nevertheless, annual surveys since 2014 have demonstrated that the initial recovery of MPA assemblages was much quicker than that seen following the cessation of chronic towed fishing impact in 2008. Likewise, General Additive Mixed Effect Models (GAMMs) showed that inside the MPA increases in diversity metrics post-Storm were greater and more consistent over time than post-Bottom-Towed Fishing. As extreme events are likely to become more common with climate change, wave exposure observations indicated that 29% of coastal reef MPAs around the United Kingdom may be exposed to comparable wave climate extremes, and may be similarly impacted. This paper therefore provides an insight into the likely extent and magnitude of ecological responses of seabed ecosystems to future extreme disturbance events"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Davies et al., 2020\nThe soundscape of the marine environment is a relatively understudied area of ecology that has the potential to provide large amounts of information on biodiversity, reproductive behaviour, habitat selection, spawning and predator–prey interactions. Biodiversity is often visually assessed and used as a proxy for ecosystem health. Visual assessment using divers or remote video methods can be expensive, and limited to times of good weather and water visibility. Previous studies have concluded that acoustic measures, such as the Acoustic Complexity Index (ACI), correlate with visual biodiversity estimates and offer an alternative to assess ecosystem health. Here, the ACI measured over 5 years in a Marine Protected Area (MPA) in the UK, Lyme Bay, was analysed alongside another monitoring method, Baited Remote Underwater Video Systems (BRUVs). Two treatments were sampled annually in the summer from 2014 until 2018 with sites inside the MPA, as well as Open Control sites outside of the MPA. Year by year correlations, which have been used elsewhere to test ACI, showed significant correlations with Number of Species and ACI. However, the sign of these correlations changed almost yearly, showing that more in-depth analyses are needed. Multivariate analysis of the benthic assemblage composition (from BRUVs) was carried out by Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance (PERMANOVA) using Distance Matrices. Although not consistently correlating with univariate measures, the ACI was significantly interacting with the changing benthic assemblage composition, as it changed over time and protection (Inside vs Outside the MPA). ACI showed potential to allude to shifting benthic communities, yet with no consistency when used alongside univariate measures of diversity. Although it is not without its own disadvantages, and thus should be developed further before implementation, the ACI could potentially reflect more complex changes to the benthos than simply the overall diversity."

With targets to protect 30% of marine areas by 2030, effectiveness of MPAs to protect designated space is important. In Lyme Bay (South West UK) two co-located MPAs have each adopted different management styles to exclude mobile demersal fishing; a Special Area of Conservation (SAC) protecting the known extent of sensitive reef habitat and an area including a mosaic of reef and sedimentary habitats where the whole-site is protected from mobile demersal fishing under a Statutory Instrument (SI). Underwater videography, both towed (individuals m\\(^{-2}\\)) and baited (MaxN), was used to enumerate change over time of reef species (Number of Taxa, Total Abundance, Functional Richness and Functional Redundancy) in the MPAs and nearby control areas (2008-2019). Total abundance and functional redundancy of sessile taxa and functional richness of mobile taxa increased, while the number of sessile or mobile taxa, functional richness of sessile taxa, total abundance of mobile taxa or functional redundancy of mobile taxa did not differ from nearby control sites. Over time, both management styles did result in increases in sessile and sedentary taxa diversity relative to open controls, with increases in total abundance of 15% and 95% in the ‘feature based’ and whole-site MPAs respectively alongside increases in the number of sessile taxa of 44% over time in the ‘feature based’ MPA. However, the mobile taxa in the whole-site MPA showed levels of functional redundancy 7% higher than the ‘feature based’ MPA, indicative of a higher community resilience inside the whole-site MPA to perturbations, such as storms or biological invasions. Increases seen in the diversity of sessile taxa we expected only in areas where mobile demersal fishing was excluded (~46.8% of its’ areas). Therefore, if the whole ‘feature based’ MPA was consistently protected, we expected to see similar levels of increase in functional extent of reef. While the ‘feature based’ MPA showed similar results over time to that of the ‘whole site’, the ‘whole site’ showed higher levels of diversity, both taxonomical and functional."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Davies et al., 2021\nDesignated using a Statutory Instrument in 2008, Lyme Bay marine- protected area (MPA) is the UK’s first and largest example of an ambitious, whole-site approach to management, to recover and protect reef biodiversity. The whole-site approach applies consistent management, in this case excluding bottom towed fishing, across the full 206 km2 extent of the MPA, thus protecting a mosaic of reef-associated habitats from regular damage, while still allowing less destructive fishing methods, such as static gear, rod and line, and diving.2. To assess the effectiveness of this management strategy for mobile taxa and the sustainability for those taxa that continue to be targeted, Exploited and Non- Exploited species’ populations were compared inside the MPA, relative to open control sites spanning 11 of the 12 years of designation. baited remote underwater video systems (BRUVs) were deployed annually to assess mobile benthic and demersal fauna.3. Overall, the number of taxa significantly increased in the MPA relative to the open controls while total abundance increased in both treatments.4. Exploited fish showed increases in number of taxa (430%) and total abundance (370%) inside the MPA over 11 years.5. Likewise, but to a lesser degree in the open controls, number of taxa of commercially Exploited fish increased over time, potentially showing ‘spillover’ effects from the MPA.6. Non-Exploited fish did not show such changes. Regardless of constituting the majority of the fishery value, highly valuable Exploited invertebrates showed no significant changes over time.7. Synthesis and applications. The Lyme Bay marine- protected area shows importance of protecting a whole site, comprising mosaics of different benthic habitats, through protection of sessile organisms that contribute to essential fish habitats."

The current project I am taking part in aims to create scaleable and generaliseable classification models to use Spectral Reflectance measured from Satellite imagery to predict spatial extent of intertidal habitats across the whole of Northern Europe. This can assist biodiversity management over great spatial scales while also providing real-time data (assuming regular available satellite imagery).\n\n\nI completed my PhD based at the University of Plymouth. The title of my PhD was: The Effectiveness of Partially Protected Marine Areas for Ecosystem Based Fisheries Management. The work centred around the Marine Protected Area (MPA) in Lyme Bay (UK), which excluded all demersal towed fishing activity across 206km\\(^2\\) of seabed in 2008. University of Plymouth staff and students have monitored the benthic environment across the bay (inside and outside the MPA) annually, using a range of underwater sampling equipment.\nThe methods include:\n\nPassive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM)\nTowed Underwater Video Systems (TUVs)\nBaited Remote Underwater Video Systems (BRUVs)\n\n\nThe objective of my PhD was to assess how the protection affected the benthic ecosystems inside vs outside the MPA.\n\n\nMy duties included:\n\nthe continued application of annual surveys alongside other members of the team,\norganisation of the 12 year data sets for BRUVs and TUVs, and 5 years of PAM recordings,\nanalysis of BRUVs and PAM data sets,\nstatistical analysis of the time series data,\nassessment of the applicability of the methods,\nthe creation of journal style articles for publication.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince completing my PhD, I have been employed as an Assistant Project Manager and Post-Doctoral Researcher delivering monitoring goals within the team with whom I completed my PhD.\n\n\n\nAfter my PhD I was a Post-Doctoral researcher at the University of Plymouth assessing changes in Blue Carbon stores around Jersey in the UK Channel Islands. The project aimed to assess the stored carbon within sedimentary habitats in Jersey. This information was then being used alongside spatial habitat data to create a preliminary estimate of total carbon within sedimentary habitats across Jersey’s territorial waters. Cores and Grabs were taken across Jersey’s waters, then prepared and analysed for their total and organic carbon content with CHN analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have worked and assisted in many projects across the UK including:\n\nLong term MPA Assessment\nEcological Impact Assessment of a 50 Year Storm\nFisheries Stock Assessment\nSeagrass Mapping\nWave Energy Device Impact Assessment\nOffshore Aquaculture Impact Assessment\nSedimentary Blue Carbon Assessment\nAcoustic Assessments of Marine Soundscapes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther afield, I have also worked in:\n\nthe Galapagos Islands assessing both Plastic Pollution and Biological Invasive species\nthe Ecuadorian fisheries department (Instituto Nacional de Pesca) asssessing bycatch of protected species\nthe Himalayan mountains and the Ganges River alongside National Geographic researchers assessing plastics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThrough this work I have collaborated with researchers from across the globe and across many disciplines combining in-the-field research (Underwater videography (BRUVs), boatwork, snorkelling, SCUBA, intertidal estuary surveys) and in the lab (Sediment core and grab preparation). Often, I have then been responsible for data organisation, analysis and presentation."
