      "contents": "\nWho am I?\nMy name is Bede Ffinian Rowe Davies a Post-Doctoral Researcher in\nMarine Ecology.\n\n\n\n\nI completed my PhD based at the University of Plymouth. The title of\nmy PhD was: The Effectiveness of Partially Protected Marine\nAreas for Ecosystem Based Fisheries Management. The work\ncentred around the Marine Protected Area (MPA) in Lyme Bay (UK), which\nexcluded all demersal towed fishing activity across 206km\\(^2\\) of seabed in 2008. University of\nPlymouth staff and students have monitored the benthic environment\nacross the bay (inside and outside the MPA) annually, using a range of\nunderwater sampling equipment. The methods include Passive Acoustic\nMonitoring (PAM), Towed Underwater Video Systems (TUVs) and Baited\nRemote Underwater Video Systems (BRUVs). The objective of my PhD was to\nassess how the protection affected the benthic ecosystems inside vs\noutside the MPA. My duties included: the continued application of annual\nsurveys alongside other members of the team; organisation of the 12 year\ndata sets for BRUVs and TUVs, and 5 years of PAM recordings; analysis of\nBRUVs and PAM data sets, statistical analysis of the time series data;\nassessment of the applicability of the methods and the creation of\njournal style articles for publication. Since completing my PhD, I have\nbeen employed as an Assistant Project Manager and Post-Doctoral\nResearcher delivering monitoring goals within the team with whom I\ncompleted my PhD.\n\nWhat do I do?\n\n\n\n\nI am currently a Post-Doctoral researcher at the University of\nPlymouth assessing changes in Blue Carbon stores around Jersey in the UK\nChannel Islands. The project aims to assess the stored carbon within\nsedimentary habitats in Jersey. This infomation is then being used\nalongside spatial habitat data to create a preliminary estimate of total\ncarbon within sedimentary habitats across Jersey’s territorial waters.\nCores and Grabs were taken across Jersey’s waters, then prepared and\nanalysed for their total and organic carbon content with CHN\nanalysis.\n\nExperience\n\n\n\nProjects\n\n\n\n\nI have worked and assisted in many projects across the UK including:\nLong term MPA Assessment, Ecological Impact\nAssessment of a 50 Year Storm, Fisheries Stock\nAssessment, Seagrass Mapping, Wave\nEnergy, Device Impact Assessment,\nOffshore Aquaculture Impact Assessment,\nSedimentary Blue Carbon Assessment &\nAcoustic Assessments of Marine Soundscapes.\nFurther afield, I have also worked in:\nthe Galapagos Islands assessing both Plastic Pollution and\nBiological Invasive species\nthe Ecuadorian fisheries department (Instituto Nacional de Pesca)\nasssessing bycatch of protected species\nthe Himalayan mountains and the Ganges River alongside National\nGeographic researchers assessing plastics.\n\n\n\nThrough this work I have collaborated with researchers from across\nthe globe and across many disciplines combining in-the-field research\n(Underwater videography (BRUVs), boatwork, snorkelling, SCUBA,\nintertidal estuary surveys) and in the lab (Sediment core and grab\npreparation). Often, I have then been responsible for data organisation,\nanalysis and presentation.\n\nMethods\n\n\n\n\nThe statistical analyses have ranged from assessing changes in\nacoustic complexity index (a univariate measure of ecosystem noise), to\nassemblage level changes (multivariate) and from abundance and diversity\nof taxa of importance, to whole ecosystem functional trait analysis. The\nmethods used have mostly been applied within the coding language {r},\nwith models being applied of varying complexity,in both frequentist and\nbayesian frameworks, from one or two fixed effects to more complex mixed\neffects, hierarchical models and General Additive Models. These models,\nas the data have been varying in distributions and characteristics, have\nbeen similarly variable, with models using gaussian, poisson, beta,\ngamma and bernoulli/binomial distributions and\nzero-inflated/zero-altered (hurdle etc) alternatives. These analysis\nmethods have been used to provide visiualisations of predicted scenarios\nacross many of the projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
