## Statistical Experience

::: {.floatting}

```{r , echo=FALSE,out.width='60%', out.extra='style="float:right; padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/index/MonthlyCurrentFacet.gif")

```

My statistical exoeriences have ranged from:

- assessing changes in acoustic complexity index (a univariate measure of ecosystem noise), to assemblage level changes (multivariate abundance)

- abundance and diversity of taxa of importance, to whole ecosystem functional trait analysis.

The methods used have mostly been applied within the coding language {r}, with models being applied of varying complexity, in both **frequentist** and **bayesian** frameworks, from one or two fixed effects to more complex mixed effects, hierarchical models and General Additive Models.

```{r , echo=FALSE,out.width='70%', out.extra='style="float:right; padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/index/Figure1.png")

```

These models, as the data have been varying in distributions and characteristics, have been similarly variable, with models using:

- gaussian

- poisson

- beta

- gamma 

- bernoulli/binomial

- zero-inflated/zero-altered alternatives.  

These analysis methods have been used to provide visiualisations of predicted scenarios across many of the projects.
