The title of\nmy PhD was: The Effectiveness of Partially Protected Marine Areas for\nEcosystem Based Fisheries Management. The work centred around the Marine\nProtected Area (MPA) in Lyme Bay (UK), which excluded all demersal towed\nfishing activity across 206km\\(^2\\) of\nseabed in 2008. University of Plymouth staff and students have monitored\nthe benthic environment across the bay (inside and outside the MPA)\nannually, using a range of underwater sampling equipment. The methods\ninclude Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM), Towed Underwater Video\nSystems (TUVs) and Baited Remote Underwater Video Systems (BRUVs). The\nobjective of my PhD was to assess how the protection affected the\nbenthic ecosystems inside vs outside the MPA. My duties included: the\ncontinued application of annual surveys alongside other members of the\nteam; organisation of the 12 year data sets for BRUVs and TUVs, and 5\nyears of PAM recordings; analysis of BRUVs and PAM data sets,\nstatistical analysis of the time series data; assessment of the\napplicability of the methods and the creation of journal style articles\nfor publication. Since completing my PhD, I have been employed as an\nAssistant Project Manager delivering monitoring goals within the team\nwith whom I completed my PhD. My current responsibilities follow closely\nto those during my PhD.\n\nWhat do I do?\n\n\n\n\nI am currently a Post-Doctoral researcher at the University of\nPlymouth assessing changes in Blue Carbon stores around Jersey in the UK\nChannel Islands. The project aims to assess the stored carbon within\nsedimentary habitats in Jersey. This infomation is then being used\nalongside spatial habitat data to create a preliminary estimate of total\ncarbon within sedimentary habitats across Jerseyâ€™s territorial waters.\nCores and Grabs were taken across Jerseys waters, then prepared and\nanalysed for their total and organic carbon content with CHN\nanalysis.\n\nExperience\n\n\n\nProjects\n\n\n\n\nI have worked and assisted in many projects across the UK including\nlong term MPA assessment, Ecological Impact of 50 Year Storm, Fisheries\nStock assessment, Seagrass mapping, Wave Energy Device Impact\nassessment, Offshore Aquaculture Impact assessment, Sedimentary Blue\nCarbon Assessment and Acoustic Assessments of Marine Soundscapes.\nFurther afield, I have also worked in: the Galapagos Islands assessing\nboth Plastic Pollution and Biological Invasive species; the Ecuadorian\nfisheries departement (INP) asssessing bycatch of Protected species and\nalongside National Geographic researchers assessing Plastics across the\nHimalaya mountains and the Ganges River.\n\n\n\nThrough this work I have collaborated with researchers from across\nthe globe and across many disciplines combining in the field research\n(Underwater videography (BRUVs), boatwork, snorkelling, SCUBA,\nintertidal estuary) and in the lab (Sediment core and grab prepation).\nOften, I have then been responsible of data organisation, analysis and\npresentation.\n\nMethods\n\n\n\n\nThe statistical analyses have ranged from assessing the change in\nacoustic complexity index (a univariate measure of ecosystem noise), to\nassemblage level changes (multivariate) and from abundance and diversity\nof taxa of importance, to whole ecosystem functional trait analysis. The\nmethods used have mostly been applied within the coding language r, with\nmodels being applied of varying complexity in both frequentist and\nbayesian frameworks, from one or two fixed effects to more complex mixed\neffect, hierarchical models and General Additive Models. These models,\nas the data have been varying in distributions and characteristics, have\nbeen similarly variable, with models using gaussian, poisson, beta,\ngamma and bernoulli/binomial distributions and\nzero-inflated/zero-altered (hurdle etc) alternatives. These analysis\nmethods have been used to provide visiualisations of predicted scenarios\nacross many of the projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
