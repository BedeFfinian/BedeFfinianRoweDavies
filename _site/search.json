      "contents": "\nWho am I?\nMy name is Bede Ffinian Rowe Davies a Post-Doctoral Researcher in\nMarine Ecology and Remote Sensing at the University of Nantes. The\ncurrent project I am taking part in aims to create scaleable and\ngeneraliseable classification models to use Spectral reflectance\nmeasured from Satelite imagery to predict spatial extent of intertidal\nhabitats across the whole of Norther Europe. This can assist\nbiodiversity management over great spatial scales while also providing\nreal-time data (assuming regular available satelite imagery).\n\n\n\n\nI completed my PhD based at the University of Plymouth. The title of\nmy PhD was: The Effectiveness of Partially Protected Marine\nAreas for Ecosystem Based Fisheries Management. The work\ncentred around the Marine Protected Area (MPA) in Lyme\nBay (UK), which excluded all demersal towed fishing activity across\n206km\\(^2\\) of seabed in 2008.\nUniversity of Plymouth staff and students have monitored the benthic\nenvironment across the bay (inside and outside the MPA) annually, using\na range of underwater sampling equipment.\nThe methods include:\nPassive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM)\nTowed Underwater Video Systems (TUVs)\nBaited Remote Underwater Video Systems\n(BRUVs)\nThe objective of my PhD was to assess how the\nprotection affected the benthic ecosystems inside vs outside the\nMPA.\nMy duties included:\nthe continued application of annual surveys alongside other\nmembers of the team,\norganisation of the 12 year data sets for BRUVs and TUVs, and 5\nyears of PAM recordings,\nanalysis of BRUVs and PAM data sets,\nstatistical analysis of the time series data,\nassessment of the applicability of the methods,\nthe creation of journal style articles for publication.\nSince completing my PhD, I have been employed as an Assistant Project\nManager and Post-Doctoral Researcher delivering monitoring goals within\nthe team with whom I completed my PhD.\n\nWhat have I done?\n\n\n\n\nAfter my PhD I was a Post-Doctoral researcher at the University of\nPlymouth assessing changes in Blue Carbon stores around Jersey in the UK\nChannel Islands. The project aimed to assess the stored carbon within\nsedimentary habitats in Jersey. This information was then being used\nalongside spatial habitat data to create a preliminary estimate of total\ncarbon within sedimentary habitats across Jersey’s territorial waters.\nCores and Grabs were taken across Jersey’s waters, then prepared and\nanalysed for their total and organic carbon content with CHN\nanalysis.\n\nExperience\n\n\n\nProjects\n\n\n\n\nI have worked and assisted in many projects across the UK\nincluding:\nLong term MPA Assessment\nEcological Impact Assessment of a 50 Year Storm\nFisheries Stock Assessment\nSeagrass Mapping\nWave Energy Device Impact Assessment\nOffshore Aquaculture Impact Assessment\nSedimentary Blue Carbon Assessment\nAcoustic Assessments of Marine Soundscapes.\nFurther afield, I have also worked in:\nthe Galapagos Islands assessing both Plastic Pollution and\nBiological Invasive species\nthe Ecuadorian fisheries department (Instituto Nacional de Pesca)\nasssessing bycatch of protected species\nthe Himalayan mountains and the Ganges River alongside National\nGeographic researchers assessing plastics.\n\n\n\nThrough this work I have collaborated with researchers from across\nthe globe and across many disciplines combining in-the-field research\n(Underwater videography (BRUVs), boatwork, snorkelling, SCUBA,\nintertidal estuary surveys) and in the lab (Sediment core and grab\npreparation). Often, I have then been responsible for data organisation,\nanalysis and presentation.\n\n\n\n\n",
